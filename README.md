   - Select your existing Minecraft server folder
   - The application will automatically detect your server JAR and plugins
   - Configuration will be saved automatically

2. **Accept EULA** (if not already done):

   - Change `eula=false` to `eula=true`
   - Save the file

3. **Start Your Server**:
   - Go to the "Server Control" tab

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Download Minecraft Server JAR**:

## Usage Tips

### Server Management
- **Console Commands**: Use the command input at the bottom of the console to send commands
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Always use the "⬛ Stop Server" button instead of closing the application
- **Memory Settings**: Allocate at least 1GB (1024MB) for small servers, 2-4GB for medium servers

### Plugin Installation
- **Compatibility**: Ensure plugins are compatible with your server version
- **Dependencies**: Some plugins require other plugins to work (check plugin descriptions)
- **Testing**: Test new plugins on a backup server before using them on production

### Configuration
- **Auto-save**: Configuration is automatically saved when you click "💾 Save Configuration"
- **Backup**: Keep backups of your server directory before making major changes
- **Port**: Default Minecraft server port is 25565

## Troubleshooting

### "Server JAR not found"
- Ensure you've selected the correct server JAR file in the Configuration tab
- Verify the file exists in the specified directory

### "Java not found"
- Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Ensure Java is added to your system PATH
- For modern Minecraft versions, use Java 17 or higher

### Server Won't Start
- Check the console for error messages
- Verify you've accepted the EULA
- Ensure no other server is running on port 25565
- Check file permissions in the server directory

### Plugins Not Loading
- Verify plugins are in the correct plugins folder
- Check plugin compatibility with your server version
- Look for error messages in the server console
- Some plugins require a server restart to load

### Search Not Working
- Check your internet connection
- Modrinth API may be temporarily unavailable
- Try searching with different keywords

## Advanced Features

### Background Server Management
The GUI can detect if a Minecraft server is already running on your system and warn you accordingly.

### Process Monitoring
Uses `psutil` to check for existing server processes and manage resources efficiently.

### Auto-detection
Automatically creates necessary directories (like the plugins folder) if they don't exist.
